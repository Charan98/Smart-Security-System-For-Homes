# Smart-Security-System-For-Homes
This is a Raspberry Pi project to implement smart security system for homes.

I have developed a security system using infrared sensor, flame sensor, a buzzer and a logitech camera.

When the infrared sensor detects an intrusion, it triggers the buzzer to alert the people nearby and also activates the logitech camera and transmits the live video over the internet.
We can watch this video transmission in the MIT App that I have developed.

When ever there is fire in the building, the flame sensor will detect the fire and activate the fire alarm, in this case the buzzer to alart the people around.

We can modify this project further, so that when ever the infrared sensor detects intrusion or the flame sensor detects fire in the building, we can immediately send the notification to the intended user and also directly to the emergency services like the police and the fire service so that they and prevent any catastrophe. 

We also can connect to the cloud using IBM IoT platform and can use the speech to text service to recognise any key words like "help" or "save" which triggers the security system and sends an emergency alert to family and emergency services which also shares live feed of the house security cameras so that they can respond according to the situation.
